With a natural birth you have the freedom to move, which is a great thing! Movement during labor is your friend. Gravity is helping you bring baby down and the more you move, the sooner you will have your baby.<br>Water births are becoming increasingly popular. Parents want to do all they can to bring their babies into the world, without all of the stress, confusion and tension that surrounds traditional births in hospital delivery rooms. When babies arrive in the world submerged in warm water, they are more calm, relaxed and have an overall less stressful entry into their new world.<br>It is important, however, that parents understand the type of tub that will be used for their water births. While it is feasible to use just about any type of large tub, there are some that are simply better than others. Many of the best delivery facilities use Sanijet Tubs for water births. And we are inclined to agree that these tubs really are the best choice.<br><br>Here are some of the advantages that you get when you give birth in a Sanijet Tub:<br><br><h2>A Sanitary Environment</h2><br>Most people don't understand just how prone to bacteria the average hot tub really is. That's because they don't see the large, complex maze of pipes that are used in traditional hot tubs and bubble tubs. There are literally dozens of feet of pipes, tubes and nozzles on most of these tubs. And all of that excessive piping can end up becoming a hot bed of bacterial growth. Simply cleaning these tubs is not enough, as the bacteria can easily grow in the internal piping.<br><br>Thankfully, Sanijet tubs are designed completely different than traditional hot tubs. The unique design of these hot tubs does not include excessive pipes. That means that these tubs are inherently cleaner and more sterile than traditional bubble tubs or hot tubs. You want your birthing environment to be as sanitary and free from bacteria as possible, and that is precisely what you get when you choose a birthing facility that uses Sanijet Tubs.<br><br><h2>More Relaxing</h2><br>Don't forget - you chose a water birth because it is a more soothing, relaxing environment for you and your baby. This is another reason that you'll want to opt for a Sanijet tub as your birthing environment of choice. The Sanijet tubs are about 50% quieter than traditional hot tubs. If you've ever been in a regular hot tub before, you know that they can get pretty noisy. That's certainly not what you want when ushering your new baby into the world.<br><br>Simply put, Sanijet tubs provide a more tranquil, quiet and comfortable environment than traditional hot tubs or bubble tubs. This is a benefit that mom, dad, the midwife and baby are all sure to appreciate - especially during a lengthy delivery.<br><br>Sanijet tubs provide a more sanitary and relaxing environment for water births. For these two reasons, it's easy to understand why so many water birthing experts recommend using Sanijet tubs to their clients. If you are comparing different facilities for your upcoming water delivery, we recommend choosing only a facility that uses Sanijet tubs. And if you're going all out, and actually having a tub installed, Sanijet is the smart choice.<br><br>Do you want the peace of mind that comes catching close to 2000 babies with  40 years of combined experience, call our office at 864-285-0574 to get more info from one of our midwives about haveing a water birth.<br><br><br><br><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNFv46426E4?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay;
